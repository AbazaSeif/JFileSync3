<p>File syncing with optional compression and encryption for local and WebDAV folders. For local folder encryption can use
EncFS and thus be compatible with encfs4win, BoxCryptor Classic, Encdroid and so on. (With GUI, command line, and stored
profiles.)</p>

<p>Find more on the scenarios where this tool might help you in in the growing
<a href="https://github.com/mgoellnitz/JFileSync3/wiki">project wiki</a>.</p>

<p>This software was developed because I personally needed an easy to use syncing tool to have everyday backups of highly
confidential material - business and private. And none of the services I came accross could suite these needs.</p>

<p>The second reason why I find it helpful is, that I very much rely on online-syncing tools for everyday backups and felt
forced to use more than one of these services. Using too many of them slows down your local machine too much, so I
identified a set of backup areas which didn't need online syncing but just regular cloud based backup. Some of the
syncing services available provide WebDAV backends, so I can decide to use a service online or manual (scheduled).</p>

<p>It is heavily based on the work of Jens Heidrich and the JFileSync2.2. After some hacking aroung in his code I felt that
this one here is a fork, ripping out his original remove backends and changing the purpose quite a lot.</p>

<p>JFileSync is a SourceForge project and available via the following URL:</p>

<pre><code>http://jfilesync.sourceforge.net/
</code></pre>

<p>Don't mix the derived work here and his clean software on sourceforge. Only bother him if it's related to his original
version. Other complaints go here :-) Feel free to add any issues to this project here.</p>

<h2>
<a id="online-scenario" class="anchor" href="#online-scenario" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Online Scenario</h2>

<p>You replaced (or want to) your regular backups with online syncing tools and don't have backup media anymore.
This helps doing backups of your work in remote situations where e.g. don't want to carry confidential backup media
with you.</p>

<p>Possible Solutions:</p>

<p>a) Trust the providers</p>

<p>Select any of them - I have some personal notes on the in the wiki.</p>

<p>b) Trust the providers encryption</p>

<p>Use Teamdrive, or iDrive Sync. With Teamdrive you can - in some cases - even see the encrypted files depending on the
backend you use. With iDrive Sync you have to provide a custom password as a base for the generated keys (This rips
out some functions like sharing which gives you a hint, that they really do what they are saying).</p>

<p>c) Encrypt locally on every file access and thus only sync encrypted stuff which you can still see.</p>

<p>Boxcryptor, EncFS come into my mind. Disadvantage here is the de- and encryption on nearly every access. Really locally
stored are only the encrypted files.</p>

<p>d) If you trust your local system and need to store frequently accessed files, you would like to encrypt only short
before or on backing up/syncing files.</p>

<p>This is where this software fills the gap. It can sync directories, local or webdav, and it can do this with either of
these encrypted. Additionally it can sync with encfs volumes stored in local folders. It is my common practice, that
the local encrypted folders are in turn synced with one of the online syncing services.</p>

<p>If you use EncFS in this scenario, it is possible to access the encrypted and synced files from mobile devices with
Boxcryptor Classic for iOS and Android and additionally EncFS tools for android. Also this EncFS solution is compatible
with encfs4win and of course Linux based encfs.</p>

<h2>
<a id="requirements" class="anchor" href="#requirements" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Java 7 Runtime Environment, Java 8 supported (see '<a href="http://java.oracle.com">http://java.oracle.com</a>')</p></li>
<li><p>Only when using other algorithms than AES: JCE extension  (see '<a href="http://java.oracle.com">http://java.oracle.com</a>')</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="installation-and-application-start" class="anchor" href="#installation-and-application-start" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation and Application Start</h2>

<p>Unzip the distribution file to a directory of your choice.</p>

<p>You can start the application through</p>

<ul>
<li>a Windows launcher ('JFileSync3.exe')</li>
<li>a batch file ('bin/JFileSync3.bat')</li>
<li>a Unix shell script ('bin/JFileSync3')</li>
<li>a Unity launcher script</li>
</ul>

<p>ATTENTION: Because JFileSync is distributed as a Zip archive, Unix users will have to give executable rights manually
before launching the application, e.g.: 'chmod a+rx JFileSync.sh'.</p>

<p>Nearly all functions of JFileSync3 can be controlled via the Graphical User Interface (GUI). However, JFileSync3
provides full access to all features (apart from plug-ins) via the command line interface. Call 'bin/JFileSync -help' to
get an overview of all possible command line options.</p>

<h2>
<a id="configuration" class="anchor" href="#configuration" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Configuration</h2>

<p>JFileSync works with profiles controlling which folders to use, which files to include or ommit, how to log into WebDAV
servers, and which encryption cipher and passphrase to use.</p>

<p>These profiles need to be set up and can be stored in XML files. The distribution contains a set of profile file examples
illustrating all the intended scenarios.</p>

<h2>
<a id="development-notes" class="anchor" href="#development-notes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Development Notes</h2>

<p>Required packages for JFileSync3 development (not included in the distribution):</p>

<ul>
<li>Java 7 SDK &gt;= 1.7.0 (see '<a href="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</a>') (Java 8 should be working)</li>
<li>Gradle &gt;= 1.4 (see '<a href="http://www.gradle.org">http://www.gradle.org</a>' - Recommended are versions 2.2.1 and up)</li>
</ul>

<p>Used and as a result recommended development tools:</p>

<ul>
<li>Java 7 SDK 1.7.0</li>
<li>Netbeans 8.0</li>
</ul>

<p>The following structure describes all folder and files included in the JFileSync3 source repository:</p>

<ul>
<li>src: Java source code</li>
<li>legal: The program licenses.</li>
<li>profiles: Sample syncing profiles.</li>
<li>ubuntu: Ubuntu Unity desktop integration files</li>
<li>win: start scripts for parts of the system as tools - and a Windows icon file</li>
<li>test: profiles and data for the encryption test suite</li>
</ul>

<p>The encryption backend tries its very best to avoid known plaintext attacks with filenames like in directory names
("src/main/java") and with the contents of the files.</p>

<p>The contents are compressed before they are encrypted (in most cases - depending on size and special file types) and the
software tries three algorithms to do that - LZMS, BZIP2, Deflate - in parallel.</p>

<p>The filenames are encoded, scrambled and then encrypted.</p>

<p>Metafiles to speed up access of the directory structures don't have constant names but calculated ones.</p>

<p>Passwords to derive keys from are not constant along the whole directory structure.</p>

<p>You will need the unlimited encryption add-on by Oracle for your JDK, if you want to use anything except the default
cipher AES.</p>

<p>Feel free to issue bug reports and ideas here.</p>

<h2>
<a id="building-and-packaging" class="anchor" href="#building-and-packaging" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Building and Packaging</h2>

<p>The software is built through the usual</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>gradle build</pre></div>

<p>and can be started - e.g. for IDE integration - through</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>gradle run</pre></div>

<p>A basic packaging can be generate with</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>gradle distZip</pre></div>

<p>Take the ZIP file from build/distributions.</p>

<p>Optionally - if launch4j is installed and available on your path - you can build with</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>gradle clean build launch4j
gradle distZip</pre></div>

<p>so that the distribution will contain an additional JFileSync3.exe executable file. This is the way, the distribution
packages are generated.</p>

<p>a small test-suite can be found in profiles/test (which is not packaged in the distribtions zip) and can be called via</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>gradle encryptionTest</pre></div>
